## Course synopsis

For a robot to be autonomous, it has to perceive and understand the world around it. This course introduces you to the key computer vision algorithms used in mobile robotics, such as feature extraction, structure from motion, dense reconstruction, tracking, image retrieval, event-based vision, and visual-inertial odometry (the algorithms behind Hololens, Oculus Quest, and the NASA Mars rovers).

## Objective

Learn the fundamental computer vision algorithms used in mobile robotics, in particular: filtering, feature extraction, structure from motion, multiple view geometry, dense reconstruction, tracking, image retrieval, event-based vision, and visual-inertial odometry and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) (the algorithms behind Hololens, Facebook-Oculus Quest, and the NASA Mars rovers).

## Content

Each lecture will be followed by a lab session where you will learn to implement a building block of a visual odometry algorithm in Matlab. By the end of the course, you will integrate all these building blocks into a working visual odometry algorithm.
